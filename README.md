## My process
My process was pretty simple

- I start declaring the tags of HTML and Formatting all the text
- Then i create a file of CSS and Link in HTML file
- I put my browser in mobile view with F12 and start the stylization for mobile
- I follow the order of start with the body and the main container and then go to the texts. And for last the buttons.
- After finished. Some trouble with the version for web, so i created a media query and solve the problem.
- Deploy in GitHub repository
- Deploy site
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The most important thing that i learned is how to start the project with the mobile and then go to the web version. 
Other thing as to improve my ability with buttons.
